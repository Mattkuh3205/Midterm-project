   <!--    My main motivation for going to college was to join the military after, but life had other plans for me
      <br>
      <br>
      As I went further into my major, I fell in love with programming and hardware, and I stumbled into computer engineering
      <br>
      <br>
      I am now working towards finishing my degree, creating personal projects, and learning everything I can (which you can check out on my <a href = https://github.com/Mattkuh3205> github </a>
      <br>
      <br>
      My next step in education is to get my Masters in Electrical Engineering, and then work in industry as a computer engineer in the aerospace sector (Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, etc..)
