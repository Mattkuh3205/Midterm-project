  <h1 class = "section1"> Aviation

    <p class = "p1L">
    Aviation is one of my newer main hobbies, but my interest in it started when I was around 8 or 9, when my dad took me to my first airshow.
     <br><br>
      As I got older, I got more into aviation thanks to watching Top Gun. From then I started learning more about planes in general. <br><br>
      Aviation is one of my favorite hobbies because watching planes perform something that should not be done by man is incredible. <br><br>
      Through aviation, I have gotten into flight simulators (MSFS, DCS), Photography for planes (<a href ="https://www.instagram.com/gooses_.photography/">Photography page</a>), and plane spotting<br><br>
      Aviation has also given me an interest in scale model building and history of military vehicles

  <h1 class = "section2"> Music

    <p class = "p1C">
      Music is an incredibly important part of my life. I enjoy creating music and listening to it. My first instrument was guitar, and I have been playing for nearly 10 years now. I own a total of 5 stringed instruments (3 guitars, 1 bass, 1 ukulele), a Moog synthesizer, and a bunch of other smaller instruments <br><br>
      I love music because it is an incredible form of self expression, and without it, life would not be interesting <br><br>
      Music has brought me a lot of different interests, luthiery, vintage instruments/gear, going to concerts, learning music theory, etc...
      <br><br>
      I have gotten to see bands such as Primus, Earth Wind and Fire, and solo acts like Carlos Santana, Joe Satriani, and Steve Vai
